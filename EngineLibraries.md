# Libraries used by The Render Engine #

I believe fully in code-reuse and find that it is also important to recognize those who have made my job easier.  Many times I like to reinvent the wheel, but have to catch myself so that I don't waste a lot of time.  These libraries have saved me hundreds, if not thousands of hours of development.  Thanks to the developers of these libraries sharing their work, I have been able to focus on the engine and not on supporting code.
