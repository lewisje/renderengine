 * @class A collider component is responsible for handling potential collisions by

 * @param priority {Number} Between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being highest
 *
 * @extends BaseComponent
 * @constructor
 * @description Creates a collider component which tests the collision model for
 *              potential collisions. Each frame, the component will update a potential
 *              collision list (PCL) for the host object, using its current position
 *              obtained from {@link Object2D#getPosition}. Each object which meets
 *              certain criteria will be passed to an <tt>onCollide()<tt> method which
 *              must be implemented by the host object.
 *              <p/>
 *              The event handler will be passed the time the collision was detected
 *              as its first argument, and the potential collision object as the second.
 *              The host must determine if the collision is valid for itself, and then
 *              return a value which indicates whether the component should contine to
 *              check for collisions, or if it should stop.
 *              <p/>
 *              If the <tt>onCollide()</tt> method is not implemented on the host, no 
 *              collision events will be passed.
