The Render Engine - (c)2008 Brett Fattori
---------------------------------------------------------

The Render Engine is an open source game engine written entirely in Javascript.  The intent of this engine is to provide you, the developer, with the tools necessary to create your own game without needing to first design and write an engine.  The engine has all of the capabilities to load and execute scripts which contain game objects, render contexts, and so forth.  The Render Engine is a starting point, written using a clean OO framework, from which you can extend and expand into whatever you desire.

The engine includes a couple of demonstrations using vector and sprite-based graphics.  It also includes a set of tools to aid in the development of your game.  The demonstrations and tools were written using the engine and are well documented to aid in understanding how the engine works.

The engine source is accessible through Google Code @
