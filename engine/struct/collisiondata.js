/**
 * @class An object which contains information about a collision.  
 * 	The following is the data available:
 * <ul>
 * <li>overlap - {Number} The amount of overlap in pixels</li>
 * <li>unitVector - {@link R.math.Vector2D} The collision normal</li>
 * <li>shape1 - {@link R.collision.ConvexHull} The convex hull which collided (use {@link R.collision.ConvexHull#getHostObj getHostObj} to
 * 	get the object which is using the hull)</li>
 * <li>shape2 - {@link R.collision.ConvexHull} The convex hull that was collided with (use {@link R.collision.ConvexHull#getHostObj getHostObj} to
 * 	get the object which is using the hull)</li>
 * <li>impulseVector - {@link R.math.Vector2D} A vector which can be used to just separate shape1 from shape2</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @extends R.engine.PooledObject
 * @constructor
 * @description Creates a collision data structure.
