/**
 * @class A game object is a container for components.  Each component within
 *        the host provides a portion of the overall functionality.  A game object
 *        can have any number of components of any type within it.  Components provide
 *        functionality for things like rendering, collision detection, effects, or 
 *        transformations. This way, an object can be anything, depending on it's components.
 *        <p/>
 *        A <tt>GameObject</tt> is the logical foundation for all in-game objects.  It is
 *        through this mechanism that game objects can be created without having to manipulate
 *        large, monolithic objects.  A <tt>GameObject</tt> contains {@link R.components.Base Components},
 *        which are the building blocks for complex functionality and ease of development.
 *        <p/>
 *        By building a <tt>GameObject</tt> from multiple components, the object gains the
 *        component's functionality without having to necessarily implement anything.  Many
 *        components already exist in the engine, but you are only limited by your imagination
 *        when it comes to developing new components.
 *
 * @extends R.struct.HashContainer
 * @constructor
 * @description Create a game object.
