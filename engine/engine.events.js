 * @class A static object for unformly handling events within all browser
 * 		 platforms.  The event engine is an abstraction of the jQuery event
 * 		 system.  Methods are provided for adding and removing events in
 * 		 a programmatic way.  Additionally the engine has key codes for
 * 		 common keys which aren't part of the letters or numbers.
 * 		 <p/>
 * 		 While the engine provides a low-level way to attach events, when
 * 		 working with game objects methods are provided to manage events
 * 		 better than with the engine itself.
 * 		 <p/>
 * 		 Adding an event:
 * <pre>
 * var t = $(".myElement");
 * EventEngine.setHandler(t, "click", function(event) {
 *    MyObject.evtHandler();
 * });
 * </pre>
 * @see BaseObject#addEvent
 * @see BaseObject#removeEvent
