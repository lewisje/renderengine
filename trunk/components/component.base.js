/**
 * @class All components extend from this object class.  A component is one
 *        part of an operating whole object (a {@link HostObject}) which is
 *        responsible for only a portion of the overall operation of an in-
 *        game object.  Components are broken down into five major categories:
 *        <ul>
 *          <li><b>TYPE_INPUT</b> - Input from controllers (keyboard, mouse, etc.)</li>
 *          <li><b>TYPE_TRANSFORM</b> - Performs transformations on the host object</li>
 *          <li><b>TYPE_LOGIC</b> - Handles logical operations that are not related to
 *              input and collision</li>
 *          <li><b>TYPE_COLLIDER</b> - Determines what this object is possibly colliding
 *              with, and reports those collisions via callbacks to the host.</li>
 *          <li><b>TYPE_RENDER</b> - Performs some sort of rendering operation to the context</li>
 *        </ul>
 *        Components are executed in the order listed.  First, all inputs are
 *        checked, then logic is performed.  Logic may be internal to a host object
 *        itself, but some components perform an object-centric type of logic that
 *        can be reused.  Next, collisions are checked.  And finally, rendering can
 *        occur.
 *        <p/>
 *        Within each component type set, components can be prioritized so that
 *        one component will execute before others.  Such an ordering allows for
 *        multiple components of each type to perform their tasks in an order
 *        that the host defines.
 *
