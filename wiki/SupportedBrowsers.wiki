#summary A list of browsers The Render Engine runs on
= List of Supported Browsers =

The following is a list of browsers that I have tested the engine and examples in.  As more browsers are tested and pass, I will add them to this list.  

||  *Browser*  ||  *Version*  ||  *Tested Platforms*  ||  *Support Level*  ||
|| [http://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome] || 1.0+ || Windows || Great ||
|| [http://www.firefox.com/ Mozilla Firefox] || 3.0+ || Windows || Great ||
|| [http://www.apple.com/safari/download/ Apple Safari] || 3.0+ || Windows, Mac, iPhone || Great - Win/Mac, Ok - iPhone ||
|| [http://www.opera.com/ Opera] || 9.5+ || Windows || Great ||
|| *Firefox* || 1.5,2.0 || Windows || Good||
|| *Opera* || 9.5+ || Wii || Ok - Needs optimization ||

Levels of support:
  * Fail - Engine not working on this browser
  * Poor - Most features not working
  * Ok - Runs, missing features or poor performance
  * Good - Baseline, functioning
  * Great - Fully functional with minor issues
  * Perfect - All features working as expected

==Internet Explorer Support==

For those who are using Internet Explorer, and prefer to keep their browser intact, that would like to enjoy The Render Engine and what it has to offer should consider downloading the following plug-in for Internet Explorer:

_Notes:_

  * Just as a note, the best performance of any browser is Google's _Chrome_.  Their V8 Javascript engine is just fantastic.  I'm not stating this as an endorsement, but more as a challenge for the other browser makers to step up and compete!  However, there are some features not yet supported in Chromium which need to be addressed before I _will_ endorse it.
  * Additional tests for different browsers on multiple platforms would be nice.  I only have a Windows PC and occasional access to a Mac and/or iPhone.
  * Requests for additional browsers should be added to the comments of this page.
  * There is a project to bring the Cairo (Firefox's renderer) canvas to Internet Explorer.  When this works, I will test and add IE to my list of browsers.  The !ExCanvas object doesn't perform fast enough for this engine.
  * In Firefox 1.5 and 2.0 the garbage collection, in tandem with the older Javascript engine, is passable.
