#summary A list of browsers The Render Engine runs on
= List of Supported Browsers =

The following is a list of browsers that I have tested the engine and examples in.  As more browsers are tested and pass, I will add them to this list.

||  *Browser*  ||  *Version*  ||  *Tested Platforms*  ||  *Support Level*  ||
|| *Firefox* || 1.5+ || Windows || Great ||
|| *Safari* || 3.0+ || Windows, Mac, iPhone || Great - Win/Mac, Ok - iPhone ||
|| *Opera* || 9.5+ || Windows || Great ||
|| *Chrome* || 0.3beta || Windows || Great ||

Levels of support:
  * Fail - Engine not working on this browser
  * Poor - Most features not working
  * Ok - Runs, missing features or poor performance
  * Good - Baseline, works well with notes
  * Great - Fully functional with minor issues
  * Perfect - All features working as expected

_Notes:_

  * At some point I would like to get myself a Wii so I can test Opera on that platform.
  * Additional tests for different browsers on multiple platforms would be nice.  I only have a Windows PC and occasional access to a Mac and/or iPhone.
  * Requests for additional browsers should be added to the comments of this page.
  * There is a project to bring the Cairo (Firefox's renderer) canvas to Internet Explorer.  When this works, I will test and add IE to my list of browsers.  The !ExCanvas object doesn't perform fast enough for this engine.
