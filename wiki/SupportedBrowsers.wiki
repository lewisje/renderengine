= List of Supported Browsers =

The following is a list of browsers that I have tested the engine and examples in.  As more browsers are tested and pass, I will add them to this list.

||  *Browser*  ||  *Version*  ||  *Platforms* ||
|| Firefox || 1.5+ || Windows ||
|| Safari || 3.0+ || Windows, Mac, iPhone ||
|| Opera || 9.5+ || Windows ||
|| Chrome || 0.2beta || Windows ||

_Notes:_

  * At some point I would like to get myself a Wii so I can test Opera on that platform.
  * Additional tests for different browsers on multiple platforms would be nice.  I only have a Windows PC and occasional access to a Mac and/or iPhone.
  * Requests for additional browsers should be added to the comments of this page.
