|| *Date* || *Notes* ||
|| 07/28/2010 || Split engine metrics into its own file so that it can be "compiled out" of a runtime build. Added a profile graph for metrics to visually see engine load, frame gen time, and visible objects over time. Added Billboard2DComponent to substitute as a render component when regenerating an object would negatively impact gameplay.  Added a !TouchInputComponent for devices which support touch interfaces. ||
