Ideas for the next release.  This list is always evolving...

== Version 2.0 ==

|| *Status* || *Goal* || *Description* ||
|| _75%_ || Tutorials || Build additional "basics" tutorials.  Expand wiki to include more articles about engine use and game development with the engine. ||
|| _20%_ || Browser support || iPhone/Android.  Better support for mobile platforms with less processing power.  Optimization. ||
|| _20%_ || Demo || 2D Sprite demo - Super Mario type clone.  Test for game logic, editing and object loading, level processing and loading, and level and object editing. ||
|| _10%_ || Tool || 2D game editor for creating levels, collision maps, and editing game logic. ||
|| _90%_ || New Feature || Update non-native text renderers to draw as billboards rather than render for each frame. ||
|| _95%_ || New Feature || Show critical engine metrics in a profile graph. ||
|| _30%_ || Browser Support || Add support for touch devices (such as mobile) and a demo. ||
|| _10%_ || New Feature || User Interface manager object for easily creating and loading UI's ||
|| - || New Feature || Server side support written in Java/JSP. This will be a framework for supporting multiplayer pairing, virtual file system for storing data, and game launching. ||
|| - || Browser support || Optimize performance for the Wii. ~~Add in back-version of SoundManager to support Flash 7.~~ ||
|| - || New Feature || ~~Multiplayer networking using AJAX polling and COMET.~~ Use !WebSockets to support multiplayer.  Maybe fallback to AJAX polling and/or COMET. ||
|| - || New Feature || ~~Remote filesystem utilizing a database Virtual File System (VFS)~~ Local DB storage for faster caching of objects and storage of game data. ||
|| - || Rendering Context || SVG rendering context. ||
|| - || Dev Tool || Write a _very simple_ syntax checker that will only execute when running on the Wii.  Establish common syntax problems and write regular expressions to catch them ||
|| - || Dev Tool || Add a function tracer which logs calls into and out of functions ||
|| - || Dev Tool || Implement a profiler which I can use on all platforms to test code execution times.  This should be engine specific. ||
|| - || New Feature || ~~Considering Google Labs O3D integration.~~ Looking at WebGL for future implementation of a 3D context. ||
|| - || New Feature || Box 2d JS physics support ||
|| - || Tool || Particle editor. ||
