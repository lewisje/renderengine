#summary A quick synopsis of what I'm currently working on
= Current Work =

I spent the last couple of days working on the DOM rendering context.  I'm pretty happy with what I've achieved.  In a "two birds with one stone" moment, I decided to use the Wii for testing.  It took a while, but I've gotten it working.  It's a simple app where you guide an animated sprite around the screen with the Wii remote.  Pressing the "A" button will shake the ball up a little.  It ain't much, but it's a start.

During my development on the Wii, it has come to my attention that the error handling is poor/nonexistent.  I've supplanted that with my own console, but it's still a crap-shoot.  The biggest problem, by far, is syntax errors in the code.  Opera on the Wii doesn't allow me a way to validate syntax easily.  At least with Firebug and Firebug Lite there is some information when a syntax error occurs.  I thought I had found a way, but the `window.onerror` method isn't available.

Other issues popped up and I realized I want to do a few things:

  * Write a _very simple_ syntax checker that will only execute when running on the Wii.
  * Establish common syntax problems and write regular expressions to catch them.
  * Add a function tracer which logs calls into and out of functions.
  * Implement a profiler which I can use on the Wii.

These are all currently pie-in-the-sky ideas which I'll probably end up writing before version 2.  However, if I don't get to them I've noted them in the future tasks list.
