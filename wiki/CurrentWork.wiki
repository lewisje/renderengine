= Current Work =

I've got the examples working again (except for sound~~, and I haven't verified on Safari and Opera~~)... phew.  These interpreted languages make things difficult when one wants to check for dependencies in a browser!!

I've got dependency checking working in Firefox _and Safari_.  The engine now processes a file, determining what classes a class object is dependent on before initializing it.  It has some interesting implications, but is ~~a little shaky at the moment~~ much more stable now.  ~~The exact same error is showing up in Opera and Safari, so that'll make tracking the problem down a tad easier.~~ Only Opera is still exhibiting an error.

The sound engine has also stopped working.  Not exactly sure what's going on there...

~~I'm trying to get the dependency loader working for all of the engine so that only files that are needed are loaded.  It means the examples are borked, but that's the nature of the beast.~~
