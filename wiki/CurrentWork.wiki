*Note:* I'm back... As the weather gets cooler, I'm going to get back to working on The Render Engine.



I decided, a while back, to use the _Sylvester_ math library to do 2D and 3D work.  However, after spending some time really examining the library, I've determined that what I've got (`Math2D`) bridged to _Sylvester's_ classes isn't the best solution.  First off, having a bridge, instead of using _Sylvester_ natively just leads to at least two classes for each point, rectangle, etc.

Secondly _Sylvester_, while admittedly excellent at what it's designed to do, isn't optimized for games.  There's too much object creation and destruction.  The pool of objects is constantly being refreshed and the garbage collector is working overtime.  This needs to be remedied so that _The Render Engine_ will run well on all platforms.

So, after a lot of deliberating, I'm going to integrate what _Sylvester_ does directly into the library.  I'll convert the classes to minimize object creation so that the garbage collector will get a break.  And finally, I'll see if maybe I can convince James Coglan to accept an _optimized_ version of his lib for potential game development.
