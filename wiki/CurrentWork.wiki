_07/12/2009_ Recently I've been noticing a few small bugs which are making the engine fail on both Chrome and Firefox 4.0b1.  I see issues where the engine _crashes_ (stops executing).  I'm excited to start integrating some of the newer features which both browsers support natively, but I need to get these simple crash bugs ironed out.
