#summary A quick synopsis of what I'm currently working on
= Current Work =

*Update:* I've recently modified the milestones for the v1.0 gold release.  It seems that I was taking too big of a chunk of goals to try to attain an initial full release.  Due to the complexity of the sprite editor, 2D Game editor, 2D sprites example game, etc. I have decided to move those off to a version 2.0 release.  Well, at least the 2D game editor and sprite example game.

The reasoning is that I can release v1.0 with the vector game demo and another game that is intended to test the DOM rendering context.  The latter is coming together quickly, so I feel that it can be what comprises the v1.0 release.  I also feel that 2D sprite-based games will be the future of the engine and I want to _do it right the first time._

So, after much wavering, I have locked down a release milestones schedule to get v1.0 out the door sooner rather than later.  The vector-based game is essentially complete (unless someone wants to make a nicer UI and spruce it up a bit) and the Poker/Tetris game are coming along nicely.  And, since the DOM context will support sprites, it's not much of a loss for people to develop games that don't depend on the _Canvas_ element.  I also think that games developed for the DOM will run quickly on the Wii and iPhone.

_Please Note:_ I'm not going to remove the Canvas context -- I'm just not going to focus on getting a solid demo (other than the vector demo) working on it right now.  2D sprite support for Canvas will still be included!
