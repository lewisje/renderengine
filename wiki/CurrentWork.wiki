#summary A quick synopsis of what I'm currently working on
= Current Work =

I got the Wii working! It took a little doing, since the debugging tools I have aren't the best.  But, I'm happy to announce that the Spaceroids demo and Sprite Editor are working.  The performance is horrible, at the moment, but there might be some optimizations to be had.  I should start a page with Wii guidelines so that people know what I ran into and how to overcome problems.

I'm working on creating a set of functions to simplify UI design for the editors.  It's kind of like a set of "widget" methods that will take the DOM and manipulate elements with predefined classes into functional UI elements.  This should assist in developing the UI's for each editor.

The largest tool that I want to have completed before v1.0 is the level editor for 2D game creation.  It's currently being built as part of the SMB Sprite Demo, but as I was developing it I realized just how much it would add if someone could set up the framework for a game in it.

There are four tools that I'm currently working on:

  # 2D Level Editor
  # Sprite Editor
  # Font Editor
  # Particle Effect Editor

I think that these four tools will be enough to launch a v1.0 release.  They are arranged in completion priority order.
