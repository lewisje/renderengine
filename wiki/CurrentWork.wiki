#summary A quick synopsis of what I'm currently working on
= Current Work =

_After a month off..._ I took about a month off to rest from the development of the engine.  It's a lot of work by oneself to create an engine and demos to show it off (and test new features).  I'm getting back into things slowly, and hope to get a new beta tagged shortly with some feature enhancements.  It'll probably be "Beta 1.2" or something similar.

I'm working on creating a set of functions to simplify UI design for the editors.  It's kind of like a set of "widget" methods that will take the DOM and manipulate elements with predefined classes into functional UI elements.  This should assist in developing the UI's for each editor.

The largest tool that I want to have completed before v1.0 is the level editor for 2D game creation.  It's currently being built as part of the SMB Sprite Demo, but as I was developing it I realized just how much it would add if someone could set up the framework for a game in it.

There are four tools that I'm currently working on:

  # 2D Level Editor
  # Sprite Editor
  # Font Editor
  # Particle Effect Editor

I think that these four tools will be enough to launch a v1.0 release.  They are arranged in completion priority order.
