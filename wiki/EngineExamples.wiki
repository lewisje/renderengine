#summary A list of examples using The Render Engine

The following are links to works in progress.  They are the tests that I've put together to work out the various parts of the engine:

   * [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/games/spaceroids/index.html?metrics=true Asteroids clone]
   * [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/games/spaceroids/index.html?metrics=true&2k=true Asteroids clone (particle test)]
   * [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/games/smb/index.html?metrics=true Super Mario clone]
   * [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/games/smb/index.html?edit=true&metrics=true Super Mario editor]


I'll add more as I get them completed and into the repo...
