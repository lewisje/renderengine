=Engine Examples=

The Render Engine is a fully featured engine which can be used to write both games and to write applications which are graphics intensive.  Below are examples of the engine at use.

==Asteroids Clone==

This example is a clone of Asteroids by Atari.  There are two modes in which the game runs.  The first is a clone of the original, mostly complete, with sounds and vector rendering.  It's not meant to be a complete game, but more how to make the engine work.  The second has more visual effects and some simple particle animations.  Both games run from the same source.

==Ball Bounce and the Wii==

The next game, if it can be called that, is a test I put together to get the engine running on the Wii.  It not only runs on t he Wii, but on PCs and Macs.  On the Wii, just point and click the "A" button.

==The Sprite Editor==

In addition to games, The Render Engine can be (and is) used to create applications.  In this case I'm using it to develop the Sprite Editor.  Eventually, this will be a part of the online release for the creation of sprites for usage in your games.

==Text Rendering Capabilities==

The following is a quick test I've put together to test text rendering in the three supported modes.  If your browser doesn't support rendering fonts to the canvas, you'll only see the first two (Vector and Bitmap).

==The Bitmap Font Editor==

Another tool that will be provided with the engine will dissect a bitmap image of a font for use with the canvas context.  It will analyze a bitmap for breaks between the characters, then generate a font definition.  When it's completed, the editor will allow the user to create, adjust, and remove dividers.  Currently, the editor is in its early stages.

There are more examples in development and I'll release those when they are more complete.  If you have good examples of the engine in use, let me know and I'll include them here on this page!
