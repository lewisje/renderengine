#summary A few options that can be used to set up The Render Engine
= Introduction =

There are a few ways to configure The Render Engine to your liking. The query parameters are meant to give you a method to intialize the engine with values before it runs anything.

== Query Parameters ==

The following table lists query parameters you can pass to the engine to configure it before it starts a game's execution:

|| *Query Parameter* || *Description* ||
|| `debug` ||Set this vale to `true` to enable debugging output from the engine.  The engine will try to utilize a method best suited for the browser you are running within. ||
|| `debugLevel` || The level determines the amount of output in debugging mode.  0 = Verbose, 1 = Semi-verbose, 2 = Debug messages, 3 = Warnings, 4 = Errors.  Each level, starting at Warn(2) will also display messages of the following level.  So, Debug(1) shows Warnings and Errors too. See the article about the EngineConsole for more information. ||
|| `metrics` ||Setting this value to `true` will enable the display of engine metrics collected during runtime.  You can use these values to tune your game. See [MetricsWindow this list] for values and their meaning. ||
|| `debugSound` ||To see the sound engine initialization messages, and get a better idea of what !SoundManager2 is doing, set this value to `true`.||
|| `fps` ||The FPS to default the engine to.||
|| `simWii` || `true` to simulate running on a Wii. Uses the HTMLConsole which appears in the browser's window. ||

== Engine methods ==

This table lists methods you can call, on the `Engine` global object, to modify it during runtime or from within a game.  This is, by no means, a complete list.  You should refer to the engine API for more detailed listings:

|| *Method Name* || *Description * ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#setFPS setFPS(int)] || Set the FPS the engine will attempt to render at. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#toggleMetrics toggleMetrics()] || Toggle the display of engine metrics. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#showMetrics showMetrics()] || Show the metrics display. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#hideMetrics hideMetrics()] || Hide the metrics display. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#setMetricSampleRate setMetricSampleRate()] || Set how often metrics, that are averaged, are sampled.  This is the number of generated frames between samples. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#addMetric addMetric(str,val,bool,str)] || Add a metric to the engine's metrics display. Usage: `Engine.addMetric('displayName', calculatedValue, true, '#%');` You can average the metric with the third arg.  The final argument will replace the `#` sign with the value, so you can format the output.  e.g. The value of 123 using the format `#ms` would appear as `123ms` ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#getObject getObject(str)] || Get a reference to an object created in the engine.  The string is the one returned by the engine when it was created. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#setDebugMode setDebugMode(bool)] || Enable or disable debug output. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#getDebugMode getDebugMode()] || Determine if debugging is enabled. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#isSoundEnabled isSoundEnabled()] || Determine if the sound engine initialized. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#pause pause()] || Pause the execution of the engine.  No additional frames will be processed until `run()` is called. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#run run()] || Run the engine after it has been paused. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#shutdown shutdown()] || Shutdown the engine and clean up object instances. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#getDefaultContext getDefaultContext()] || Get the engine's default rendering context.  You will need to add objects to this for the engine to process them. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#getEnginePath getEnginePath()] || Retrieve the path where the engine was started from.  All other scripts will be loaded relative to that. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#dumpScripts dumpScripts()] || Outputs all of the scripts loaded by the engine to the debugger window. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#clearScriptCache clearScriptCache()] || Clears any references to scripts that have been loaded, allowing them to be loaded again. ||
|| [http://renderengine.googlecode.com/svn/api/Engine.html#toString toString()] || Output the engine name and version. ||
